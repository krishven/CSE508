mydump [-i interface] [-r file] [-s string] expression

-i  Listen on network device <interface> (e.g., eth0).

-r  Read packets from <file> (tcpdump format).

-s  Keep only packets that contain <string> in their payload.

<expression> is a BPF filter that specifies which packets will be dumped. If no
filter is given, all packets seen on the interface (or contained in the trace)
will be dumped. Otherwise, only packets matching <expression> will be dumped.

For each packet, mydump outputs a record containing the timestamp, source and
destination MAC address, EtherType, packet length, source and destination IP
address and port, protocol (TCP, UDP, ICMP, OTHER), and the raw content of the
application-layer packet payload.
